#### Literature retrieval exercise

##### a) Identify a research topic

Research on the application of cultural hybridization in game design and development

##### b) Conduct your first search for relevant academic literature.；A record of your search terms and how many findings you encountered；A statement on how you improved/revised your search terms (which terms worked well and why, which ones did not and why?)；Relevant screenshots.

[Video game culture]

Inaccurate. Most of the search results are introducing the definition of video game culture, introducing what video game culture is. It's not relevant to the cultures and cultural hybrids that I'm looking for in games.

[video game and cultural]

It has been improved, and the searched content is roughly the same as the previous keyword, but there will be some information related to the culture reflected in the game.

[Cultural hybridization in games] 

basically related. The searched content is basically a description of the phenomenon of cultural integration in the game. The content of the article is roughly related to cultural hybridization and games.

in the UAL library [Cultural hybridization]

I got very few search results, mostly related to cultural hybrids, but almost nothing related to games.

#### Write a 500 word short story using what we learned from crip technoscience to imagine a new space station, one where difference is not erased but embraced. What does the technology look like on ths space station? How is the crew selected? What is valued in this process

Once upon a time, in a not-so-distant future, a space station was built with a mission to explore new frontiers and push the limits of human knowledge and innovation. However, this space station was not like any other before it. This station was designed to embrace difference, rather than erase it. It was built on the principles of crip technoscience, which values diversity, accessibility, and inclusivity in both technology and its users.

The technology on the space station was designed to work with, rather than against, the diverse bodies and abilities of its inhabitants. The modular and adaptive architecture of the station allowed it to be reconfigured to meet the needs of its inhabitants, whether they were able-bodied or disabled, tall or short, and so on. The station was equipped with cutting-edge assistive technologies, including exosuits that could be customized to support a wide range of physical abilities, and advanced prosthetics that could be integrated with the technology of the station itself.

The crew of the space station was carefully selected to reflect the diversity of the human population on Earth. The selection process valued difference, and the crew was made up of people from all walks of life, including people with disabilities, people from marginalized communities, and people from diverse cultural and ethnic backgrounds. The crew was trained in the principles of crip technoscience, and they worked together to create a truly inclusive and accessible environment in space.

One of the key values of the space station was to promote empathy and understanding among its inhabitants. The crew was encouraged to learn about each other's experiences and perspectives, and to find ways to support one another. The station was equipped with communication technologies that allowed crew members to stay in touch with loved ones back on Earth, and to share their experiences with the wider world.

The space station was a source of inspiration and hope for people on Earth, and it was a beacon of what was possible when difference was embraced rather than erased. The crew members were proud to be a part of this revolutionary experiment in crip technoscience, and they worked tirelessly to advance the frontiers of human knowledge and understanding.

As the years passed, the space station continued to grow and evolve, becoming a hub of scientific research and innovation. The crew members continued to push the limits of what was possible, and their work inspired a new generation of scientists, engineers, and innovators to embrace difference and work towards creating a more inclusive and accessible world.

In the end, the space station became a symbol of hope and possibility, a testament to the power of crip technoscience to bring people together and create a better future for all. The crew members returned to Earth, hailed as heroes and ambassadors for a new era of inclusivity and accessibility. And the space station remained, orbiting the Earth, a shining example of what could be achieved when difference was embraced rather than erased.
