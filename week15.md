##### As part of this course, we would like you to choose one piece of art that is relevant to the topics of “computation”, “digital innovation”, “technology”, or any other topic we have discussed in the course of this unit.

"From 'Apple' to 'Anomaly': An exploration of the digital sublime" is a solo exhibit at Autograph ABP Gallery, London. It was written by Canadian artist Trevor Paglen.

The exhibition begins with an apple, taken from René Magritte's 1964 painting Ceci n'est pas une pomme (This is not an apple). Through the "training set", many apples and apple-like apples can be identified according to the algorithm, but the categories will quickly deform and collide, and then identify new categories. From "apple" to the quickly recognizable "apple tree" "fruit" to "alcohol" "debtor" "drug addict" "homeless" "racist" and finally to the category "abnormal", Including people, many of whom are disguised, "masked," whose identities and classifications are uncertain. For example, "investors" can represent a group of men in suits; "crazy" means that humans have a series of perverted behaviors that only appear in horror movies.

Works demonstrate the widespread application of technologies such as artificial intelligence, data mining, and machine learning in contemporary society, especially in large-scale digital surveillance and data collection. Using material such as computer-generated imagery, audio, and text, Paglen seeks to present the depth and breadth of this digital surveillance and data collection, and to demonstrate the potential dangers they hold. In addition, Paglen also attempts to explore the "sublime" quality of the digital world, where "sublime" refers to a sense of beauty that makes people feel frightened and incomprehensible. He uses a variety of technological means to present this magnificent feature of numbers, aiming to challenge people's perception and understanding of the digital world.

The dangers of the digital age and the theme of a digitized world is one of the very hot topics in contemporary art. Radical Love by Heather Dewey-Hagborg and Chelsea Manning: This work explores notions of privacy and publicity, illustrating the plight of certain groups of people facing digital surveillance and data collection. The work includes sculptures made using Manning's DNA, as well as a documentary recounting Manning's experiences. Blockchain Future States by Simon Denny: This work explores the future development of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies, and the impact these technologies may have on social, economic and political structures. The Tower by Hito Steyerl: This work explores the impact of digital technologies on societies and cultures around the world. The work includes a gigantic digitally generated architectural model that demonstrates the ubiquity of digital technology in contemporary society. The above works explore the theme of the digital world from different angles and ways, some of which focus on the issues of digital surveillance and data collection, while others focus on the development of digital technologies such as blockchain technology, artificial intelligence, machine learning and so on. and cultural influences. Each entry offers a different perspective, helping viewers better understand the potential threats and opportunities in the digital world.

More than any other artist, Paglen's work includes not only digital images and videos, but also software programs and custom hardware devices created by himself. Secondly, his works pay great attention to the collection and analysis of data. He uses machine learning and artificial intelligence technology to analyze massive data sets and find rules and patterns from them. At the same time, his works pay great attention to social and political issues. He explores issues such as power, privacy, and surveillance in the digital world through digital art. Paglen presents a unique digital art style through custom hardware devices, data analysis techniques, and social issue-focused expression. His works not only have certain scientific and research value, but also have certain social and political significance, providing us with a new perspective and way of thinking about the digital world.
