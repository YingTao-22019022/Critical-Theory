We can see a lot of data about low technology and the Internet. The Internet accounts for 7% of global electricity consumption, and this figure is still growing at a rate of 12% per year. In terms of materials, the production of electronic products requires a large amount of metals with special properties, and these metals are not recycled well after use. This leads to less and less special metals, and more and more old electronic waste. These questions also lead to thinking about whether the Internet needs to be transformed into low technology.

First of all, I think the development of the Internet and technology is an irreversible process. As the main achievement of the third technological revolution, the Internet has become an indispensable thing for millions of households today. Supported by the rapid expansion of the Internet and the increasing number of high-tech devices available to consumers. From smartphones to smart homes, the internet and high-tech forces are ubiquitous in modern life. While there are certainly concerns about the impact of this development on the environment and human society, it's hard to deny that the internet and high-tech forces are here to stay. Because the way of life and even the way of generation of human beings has been changed by the Internet.

In low technology and the Internet, what we can do is reduce energy consumption reasonably and build green IT. The Internet and high-tech power are potentially negative effects. The environmental and energy consumption is indeed a concern. But the solution to this problem should not be banning the use of the Internet or banning technological development. What we should do is, one, use renewable energy to power data centers or design more energy-efficient equipment, and two, not choose IT as productivity when alternatives can be used. Low technology does bring benefits to people in some areas. But we cannot blindly support low technology and oppose the Internet. This is a practice that is not conducive to the development of science and technology and human progress.

From the perspective of artists and designers, whether to choose low-tech or high-tech to create is indeed a topic worth thinking about. With the continuous development of technology, artists and designers also want to use new technologies to assist art creation and design. From this, many majors such as computer art, human-computer interaction, and experience design have been derived. As an artist, you can reflect on whether you must use new technologies to achieve the artistic effect you want to present. It is incorrect for artists to blindly cater to technological development without considering cost and resources, and to inappropriately apply high technology in artistic creation.
