##### Before doing any text reading: Just simply take a moment to write/reflect about “What is literacy and what does it mean to call computer programming a literacy?” (around 250 words)

Literacy is the ability to read, write, and understand a particular set of symbols or written language, which is necessary for communication and acquiring knowledge. Traditionally, literacy has referred to the ability to read and write in a language, usually a person's native language, and has been considered a key factor in personal and social development.

In recent years, the definition of literacy has expanded to include digital literacy, which refers to the ability to use technology and the internet to access, understand, and create information. This includes a range of skills, such as the ability to search and find information online, use email and social media, and create digital content such as documents and presentations.

Computer programming is often referred to as a literacy because it involves the ability to read, write, and understand a particular set of symbols and syntax that make up a programming language. Just as someone who is literate in a language can communicate and understand written text, someone who is literate in programming can understand and create software and other digital systems.

Programming literacy is becoming increasingly important in the modern world, as technology continues to play a larger role in many aspects of life. Knowing how to program allows individuals to create digital solutions to problems and communicate with technology in a way that is becoming increasingly necessary in a growing number of careers and fields.

In addition to providing practical skills, programming literacy also involves critical thinking and problem-solving skills, as well as the ability to think logically and systematically. These skills can be transferable to other areas of life, making programming literacy a valuable asset for individuals and communities.

In conclusion, referring to computer programming as a literacy emphasizes the importance of this skill in the modern world, and the need for individuals to be able to understand and work with technology in order to fully participate in today's society.

##### After reading the assigned text: What are the new thoughts that come to you and help problematising the notion of coding literacy? Which quotes or sentences inspire you to think more? (around 350 words, or more if you like)

Coding literacy can be seen as a new form of literacy that is necessary for full participation in a digital society. It involves not only the ability to read and write code, but also the ability to understand and use technology in a critical and creative way.

However, the notion of coding literacy also raises questions about who has access to these skills and who is excluded. Coding literacy can be seen as a form of digital divide, with some individuals and communities having greater access to technology and education, while others are excluded.

In addition, the relationship between coding literacy and other forms of literacy is also an area of concern. For example, does coding literacy enhance or replace traditional forms of literacy, such as reading and writing in a language? How does coding literacy intersect with other forms of digital literacy, such as media literacy or data literacy?

Furthermore, the concept of live coding, as described in the book "Live coding: a user's manual", raises questions about the role of improvisation and creativity in coding. This new form of coding literacy emphasizes the idea of coding as a dynamic, creative process that is not simply about following predetermined instructions, but about creating and shaping technology in real time.

In "My mother was a computer: Digital subjects and literary texts," the relationship between technology and humanity is explored, highlighting the ways in which digital technologies have changed our understanding of ourselves and the world around us. This raises questions about the role of coding literacy in shaping our digital identities and the implications for our sense of self and our relationships with others.

Overall, the notion of coding literacy is complex and multifaceted, and raises a range of questions about the intersection of technology, literacy, and identity. These questions highlight the need for a critical and interdisciplinary approach to coding literacy, one that takes into account not just the technical skills involved, but also the cultural, social, and ethical implications of our relationship with technology.
